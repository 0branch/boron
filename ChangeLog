			Boron Change Log

V2.0.0 - 1 Feb 2019

  * Evaluator rewritten to use the stack more efficiently.
  * Func creates local variables for set-word! values.  Added /extern option
    to preserve any external bindings.
  * Changed int! datatype to be 64 bits.
  * Renamed decimal! datatype to double!.
  * Added multiple brace string! syntax to more easily deal with embedded text.
  * Added hash-map! datatype.
  * Added format & setenv functions.
  * Removed big-num! datatype.  The type slot is kept so a full implementation
    could be added in the future.
  * Change serialized format ID to BOR2.  This handles 64-bit int!, hash-map!,
    and stores logic! with one less byte.
